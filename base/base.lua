--- Loads global modules. Also takes care of initializing the random number generator. <br/>
-- General informations: <br/>
-- The coordinate systems y-direction points towards the opponent goal. <br/>
-- The x-direction points from the left to the right border. <br/>
-- It is centered on the kickoff point. <br/>
-- Angles are oriented counter-clockwise, 0 points in positive x-direction. <br/>
-- Angles are measured in radians. <br/>
-- All lengths are unless specified otherwise denoted in meters.
-- Speed in m/s and acceleration in m/s^2.
